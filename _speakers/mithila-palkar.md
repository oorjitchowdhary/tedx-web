In February 2018, Forbes India named Mithila Palkar in their 30 Under 30 list of young achievers. While growing up Mithila Palkar lived with her grandparents, who she described as 'strict'. At the time when Palkar decided to pursue the career of acting, it was not approval she met with. But being a strong minded, young and independent girl she paved her way through and has now become a prominent youth icon.
